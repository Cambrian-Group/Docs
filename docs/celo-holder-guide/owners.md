## Stock Exchange Traded ETP

Trade the ETP commodity like a stock on a regulated European stock exchange; or open an account on a broker platform, purchase CoinShares ETP shares through the broker platform, and put them into the investment portfolio together with other investments, which will be managed by the broker on behalf of the broker. 

- Trading ETPs is similar to trading shares but there are some important differences.

Similarities: The basic process for buying and selling ETPs is the same as trading shares. Orders (market, limit, etc.) are entered during exchange trading hours via a normal brokerage account. Settlement of the trade takes place two business days after the transaction (T+2). For a purchase, legal ownership of the ETP is transferred to the investor and for a sale, funds are deposited into their account.

Differences: Despite the similarities in the trading process, there are some additional considerations when trading ETPs, such as the role of the market maker and the best time during market hours to trade ETPs.

CoinShares ETPs are listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), Xetra, Euronext Paris, Euronext Amsterdam and Borsa Italiana. Investors can buy or sell ETPs electronically on these secondary markets through their broker, with the same order types as shares, but not directly with CoinShares.

ETPs settle the same way as shares through the CREST settlement system. Therefore, investors who can trade/settle shares on these exchanges can also trade CoinShares ETPs in the same way. CoinShares ETPs track some of the most liquid benchmarks, commodities, and stocks worldwide, therefore there is substantial underlying liquidity in our ETPs.

CoinShares has market maker arrangements with HelloBank. A market maker is a professional trader who is appointed by the exchange or the product issuer to provide liquidity in the ETPs by providing quotes throughout the trading day and updating their prices to reflect changes in the underlying markets. Market makers also play an important role in ensuring that buyers and sellers of ETPs can transact at prices close to the net asset value (NAV) of the ETPs.

In practise, each day CoinShares publishes the list of ETPs, enabling the market maker to calculate the NAV of the ETPs throughout the trading day. This helps the market maker to more accurately price the ETPs. They place a ‘spread’, around the NAV, resulting in a big and offer price, at which to buy or sell the ETPs.

Order book liquidity is provided by the market maker (HelloBank) who enters into agreements with the LSE, Xetra, Euronext Paris, Euronext Amsterdam, Borsa Italiana, and CoinShares. This ensures that bid and offer prices, are provided continuously throughout market hours. Thus, investors can buy and sell CoinShares ETPs as they would normally trade shares, using the usual equity order types such as ‘limit’, ‘market’, ‘stop loss’, etc. Its advisable investors use ‘limit’ orders and avoid ‘market’ ones. The minimum size to trade our ETP universe is 1 share.
