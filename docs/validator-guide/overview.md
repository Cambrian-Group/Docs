# Privacy Policy

Last Updated: May 2023.

___

This Privacy Policy governs the collection, use, maintenance, and disclosure of information that the CoinShares Group collects from its users.


## OUR COMMITMENT TO DATA PRIVACY

Protecting the privacy of individuals who provide us with Personal Data (as defined below) is very important to CoinShares International Limited (“CoinShares”, “we”, “our”, us) and to the way we do business. You have shown your trust in us by interacting with www.coinshares.com and etp.coinshares.com (the “Websites”), and we value that trust.

To this end, we are committed to respecting local data privacy legislations (together “Applicable Laws”), in particular,

the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation and Data Protection Act 2018, 

the Data Protection (Jersey) Law, 2018 and the Data Protection Authority (Jersey) Law, 2018 (together the “DPL”),

the (EU) 2016/679 General Data Protection Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of persons with regard to the processing of personal data (“the GDPR”).



## Data Protection Officers

When you are using the Website, we are the Personal Data Controller. This means that we determine the purposes and means by which your data is processed. “Controller”, “Joint controller” or “Processor”, used in this Policy, refer to the terms defined in Article 4 of the GDPR.


Pursuant to Article 37 of the GDPR, we are not required to appoint a Data Protection Officer at the group level, although we understand the importance of ensuring good governance of this system.


We have appointed our Compliance Function with the duty to ensure that our processing operations comply with this Policy and, more generally, with the Applicable Laws. The Compliance Function will endeavour to answer any questions or requests in relation to the processing of your data, your rights, and our Policy. However, the Compliance Function is not the same as a Data Protection Officer. 


If you have any questions or requests regarding the processing of your Personal Data, please email us at the following address: privacy@coinshares.com

## WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE YOUR PERSONAL DATA?

The provision of your Personal Data may be:

necessary to enter a contract with us (e.g., due diligence documents and financial data), but not mandatory as you could refuse to provide it. In that case, it will however expose yourself to the risk of seeing the benefit of a contract taken away from you;

necessary, for us to be able to answer your question (e.g., when you reach out to our Customer Support and provide identification data), or solve your issue (e.g. while making a complaint). In that case, failure to provide such Personal Data could prevent us from handling these matters effectively;

not mandatory (e.g., non-necessary cookies and tracking technologies), as it is only based on your consent. If you refuse to provide some of these personal data, it could however prevent us from offering the best user experience of our Websites.

### AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING AND PROFILING

You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects or similarly significantly affects you. Please note that we may use automated decision-making systems, especially in the context of preventing fraud in relation to our regulatory obligations. Our Compliance Function may proceed to risk screening of CoinShares potential investors to ensure we can comply with AML/CFT regulations. However, no decision is exclusively based on such a type of processing, and each decision always requires human intervention at the very end. This means that the benefit of a contract could be taken away from you, but by means of a decision that is not fully systematised.


## HOW WE PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA

We collect and process information relating to you and your use of the Websites and its related services you can access through browsing. How we handle it differs as set out below:



## HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL DATA?

We retain the data collected for the time strictly necessary for the purpose of the processing, and within the limits provided for by Applicable Laws if it allows longer retention.

Unless explicitly stated in this Policy, the Personal Data we process is deleted or anonymized as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected and if the deletion does not conflict with our legal retention obligations.



## HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL DATA?

We adopt appropriate data collection, storage, processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorised access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your Personal Data, username, password, transaction information, and data stored on the Website. All Personal Data is dealt with in accordance with the Applicable Laws. 

We designed our systems with your security and privacy in mind. We implemented technical and organisational security measures to protect your data from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised access or disclosure, in particular: Ultra-secure encryption; Secure servers; Backups; Continuous monitoring.

We maintain physical, technical, administrative, and procedural safeguards to protect Personal Data, and access to Personal Data is limited to the employees who require it for their job functions. CoinShares is ISO 27001 certified, demonstrating thereby our engagement to maintain a secure platform for our customers, under strict design, procedures, controls, and continual improvement.

## How do we share your Personal Data?

We will only share your Personal Data with third parties as described in this Policy and ensure the data recipients follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Policy.

We may share your Personal Data with:

Group companies: Relevant departments from the Group will receive your Personal Data if they need it to contribute to the purpose of processing. We may transfer data as part of our business operations, to meet our legitimate interests of carrying out our internal administrative activities efficiently and to improve our products and services. Group companies act as individual data Controllers.

Service providers, affiliates, and commercial partners: These recipients act as Processors and help us with our business operations, and only have access to Personal Data necessary for the performance of their functions and may not use it for any other purpose. Processors are also carefully selected and contractually obliged to ensure the confidentiality and security of your Personal Data that they process on our behalf.

Third parties, including governmental authorities and law enforcement: We may transfer your Personal Data to the relevant public authorities to i) defend our legal rights, interests, or property and any of its related entities; ii) protect the safety and security of our customers or members of the public; or iii) protect against fraudulent activities, or comply with Applicable Laws, subpoena, or legal process.

CoinShares has a legitimate interest in being able to perform these transactions (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR).

## THIRD-PARTY LINKS

Our Websites may contain links to third-party websites, including social media sites. By including a link to a third-party website, we do not endorse or recommend any products or services offered or information contained at the third-party website. Any access to and use of such linked websites is not governed by this Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third-party websites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third-party websites. If you decide to visit a third-party website via a link contained in or by the Website, you do so at your risk.


## ASSERTING YOUR RIGHTS

You may request, for example, to access, correct, or delete Personal Data that you have provided to us. You will not be permitted to examine the Personal Data of any other person or entity and may be required to provide us with Personal Data to verify your identity prior to accessing any records containing information about you.

Unless stated otherwise by the Applicable Laws or any other legal provision or applicable regulations, you may exercise the following rights:

Right of access: You have the right to obtain confirmation from CoinShares to whether your Personal Data is being processed. In that case, you have the right to request a copy of the Personal Data and additional information such as the purposes of the processing, the categories of Personal Data concerned, where the data came from and the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the Personal Data have been or will be disclosed. To request a copy of the Personal Data undergoing processing does not mean that you always have the right to obtain the document itself where your Personal Data occurs. The right of access should not be confused or equated with right to access official documents from an authority. For additional copies requested by you, we may charge a reasonable fee based on administrative costs.

Right to rectification: You have the right to obtain from us the rectification of inaccurate Personal Data concerning you. Depending on the purposes of the processing, you have the right to have incomplete Personal Data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.

Right to erasure: In certain cases, you have the right to ask us to erase your Personal Data if, for example, the Personal Data is no longer necessary in relation to the purpose, you withdraw your consent and there is no legal ground for us to process the Personal Data, the Personal Data have been unlawfully processed or you have objected to the processing and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing. To the extent that it is necessary to continue the processing of your Personal Data, for example to fulfil our legal obligations or to establish, exercise or defend legal claims, we are not obliged to delete your Personal Data. This means that certain data can be stored until we are no longer obliged to process them. However, we will cease our communication (direct marketing/newsletter) to you after you have requested to be deleted.

Right to restriction of processing: You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your Personal Data if you believe that your Personal Data is inaccurate, our processing is unlawful or that we no longer need the Personal Data for specific purpose. If you object to the processing of Personal Data you may also request the restriction while we assess the legitimate grounds (the objection request). In this case, the respective data will be marked and the Personal Data may only be stored and processed by us for certain purposes. CoinShares will inform you when the restriction is lifted.

Right to withdraw your consent: If CoinShares processes your Personal Data based on consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us and this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing based on consent before the withdrawal.

Right to data portability: You have the right to receive a copy of the Personal Data concerning you which you have provided to us and that we process by automated means for the performance of a contract with you or based on your consent. You have the right to receive your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and this allows you to transmit those Personal Data to another entity without hindrance from us.

Right to object: You have the right to object at any time to our processing of your Personal Data with reference to your personal circumstances and provided that the processing is based on a legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR) as a legal basis. Unless there are compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, we will no longer process this data. If your Personal Data is processed for direct marketing, you have the right to object to the processing at any time and we have no right to continue processing your Personal Data for such purposes. In your objection, please state which processing purpose(s) you object to and your grounds relating to your particular circumstances.
