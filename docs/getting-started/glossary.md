# Glossary

List of key terms related to the Zsc platform, networks, tools, and blockchain technology.

___

## Account

**Contract accounts** contain the code and data of a single smart contract which can be called and manipulate its own stored data.

## Address

A unique identifier for an account on the Zsc blockchain.

## Block

The unit of update to the blockchain. A block consists of a header identifying its position in the chain and other metadata, and a body that contains a list of transactions, and data structures that describe the new state after executing those transactions.

## Blockchain

A database maintained by a distributed set of computers that do not share a trust relationship or common ownership. This arrangement is referred to as decentralized. The content of a blockchain's database, or ledger, is authenticated using cryptographic techniques, preventing its contents being added to, edited or removed except according to a protocol operated by the network as a whole.

## ZSC



## ZTB



## Zsc Dao


## DApp

Short for Decentralized Application. An application, usually a mobile application, which to deliver its functionality connects to a decentralized network like Zsc, rather than to centralized services in a single organization's data centers.

## Transaction

Requests to make a change to the state of the blockchain. They can: transfer value between accounts; execute a function in a smart contract and pass in arguments \(perhaps causing other smart contracts to be called, update their storage, or transfer value\); or create a new smart contract.

## Validator

Both: the entity in the proof-of-stake mechanism that can be associated with a validator group and subsequently elected; and a running instance of the Celo Blockchain software that is configured and ready (if elected) to participate in the Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus algorithm to agree new blocks to append to the blockchain ledger.

## Wallet

A DApp that allows a user to manage an account, and usually stores the associated private key.
DApp that allows a user to manage an account, and usually stores the associated private key.
