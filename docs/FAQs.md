XBT is short for Bitcoin - whether you see Bitcoin referred to as XBT or BTC, they all refer to the same cryptocurrency. The XBT ticker symbol is often used in the financial world to avoid potential confusion with other currencies in the market that also use the "BTC" symbol. By this logic, financial service providers (ETPs) that offer exposure to Bitcoin through products such as exchange-traded products are often referred to as XBT providers — which is the case of CoinShares’ XBT Provider. XBT Provider offers investment in Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency in the world. Investors can also purchase this ETP with USD, EUR or SEK.
