description: CoinShares ETP Value vs Price
---

Investors in ETPs buy and sell securities on a stock exchange, which is called a secondary market. ETP on-exchange prices show the price at which the ETP is trading in the secondary market with a typical bid/ask spread, which usually defers from the ETP’s NAV (Net Asset Value). In the primary market, the ETPs are always created and redeemed at NAV plus creation and/or redemption costs and is the place where Authorised Participants (AP) deal directly with the issuer of the ETP.

ETPs can be created and redeemed according to demand, which means the number of ETP units issued is variable (i.e., open-ended). This is unlike company shares where companies issue a fixed number of shares at their Initial Public Offering (IPO), which could be subsequently altered by share raisings, share splits and/or other corporate actions, which trade at a variable price, determined by pure supply and demand. The price of an ETP is not affected by supply and demand, as it is designed to track the performance of its underlying. An ETP calculates its official NAV at the end of each day using closing market prices of its underlying [i.e., from close price of underlying stock in the U.S. (t-1) to next day’s U.S. close (t)].

The price of a Short or Leveraged ETP at any point during the trading day will be determined by how much the underlying asset has risen or fallen from its closing price the day before.

In theory, the price of an ETP should be determined by its net asset value (NAV) divided by the number of securities. The NAV will fluctuate depending on the price movements of the underlying assets which, in turn, will alter the price of each ETP security.
