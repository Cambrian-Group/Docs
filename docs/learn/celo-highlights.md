# Key Concepts

Summary of benefits, features, and data behind the zsc platform.

---

## The Platform for web3

The Zsc protocol provides a platform upon which the Zsc community can create digital assets. And web3 application

**Innovative tools to build native mobile dApps:**

- On-chain Governance
- Proof-of-Stake
- Open-source
- Permissionless
- High Speed Sync for Ultra-light Clients
- Programmable (full EVM Compatibility)

## Core Contracts

Provide more diversified innovative facilities and basic services for global developers.

- Algorithmic reserve-backed stabilization mechanism
- Crypto-asset collateralized
- Native support for multiple stablecoins

## Blockchain

Open source permissionless smart contract platform built on decentralized infrastructure.

- Proof-of-Stake based consensus with high throughput, low latency, and zero carbon
- Incentives for serving mobile devices
- On-chain governance

**Proof-of-Stake**

Zsc uses a [Proof-of-Stake (PoS)](../celo-codebase/protocol/proof-of-stake) consensus algorithm. In comparison to Proof-of-Work (PoW) systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum, this eliminates the negative environmental impact and means that users can make transactions that are cheaper, faster, and where the outcome cannot be changed once complete.

**On-chain Governance**

Since great user experiences and operating a modern networking protocol need iteration and improvement, Zsc supports rapid upgrades and protocol changes via on-chain governance in which all ZTB holders can participate.

**Programmable (Full EVM Compatibility)**

ZSC includes a programmable smart contract platform that is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which is already widely adopted, familiar to developers and has strong tool support. This enables Celo to deliver rich user features and rapidly support a wide ecosystem of third-party applications and extensions.
