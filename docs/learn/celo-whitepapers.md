CoinShares ETPs provide robust, transparent, collateralised, secure, and cost-efficient exposure to underlying indices, commodities, and individual stocks, while retaining the accessibility and trading of ordinary shares.

ETPs are traded on stock exchanges throughout the day just like a share, enabling investors to gain exposure to a wide range of investments with a single trade. They bring certain features that make them compelling for investors and below we highlight some of the benefits of ETPs for investors:

## Benefits:

- Buy/Sell Flexibility: CoinShares ETPs are traded on the major UK & European stock exchanges, allowing investors to buy and sell during local trading hours. ETPs can be traded individually, just like a share in a SIPP, ISA, or regular dealing account. Entry and exit in ETPs is the same as in shares, with a corresponding two-day settlement period.

- Diversification: ETPs can help Investors diversify their portfolio across asset classes, sectors and geographies that otherwise could be difficult to access. For example, CoinShares ETPs cover market indices, specific market sectors, commodities, and specific companies. Using ETPs, investors can quickly and easily add to or build a portfolio that covers many different asset classes and geographies.

- Cost Efficiency: ETPs are cost effective on many levels. The first level of cost efficiency comes down to the fees charged by the ETP provider. ETPs are usually able to achieve lower operating costs and offer lower management fees than other forms of leveraged instruments like CFDs and factor certificates.

- Liquidity: ETPs are traded on exchanges, therefore in normal market conditions investors can buy and sell ETPs throughout the day. This intra-day liquidity enables investors to quickly move in or out of a market. Like with traditional ETFs, investors are better off looking through the underlying instrument for true indication of liquidity.

- Leverage: Gain amplified exposure to the daily performance of the underlying asset.

- Directional: Availability of long or short positions for directional investment or hedging.

- Access: ETPs provide access to a wide range of underlying assets.

- Risk Management: In extreme market conditions where markets move dramatically, losses can be significantly reduced by the Air Bag Mechanism built into CoinShares ETPs.

- Loss limited to the capital invested: The maximum loss an investor can incur is the amount invested – nothing more.

## Risks:

The ETP investment portfolio authorized and signed directly by the ETP issuer (CoinShares) does not need to consider the risk. The risks of directly buying and selling ETP on the exchange are as follows:

As with any investment, ETPs involve risk. The higher the expected return of an investment, the higher the risk and the greater the variability of returns. Consideration should be given on how an investment in ETPs fits the overall investment portfolio as ETPs have specific risks that investors should be aware of.

- Market risk: Market conditions (for example, a lack of liquidity in volatile markets) may make it difficult to buy or sell ETPs in certain circumstances. At times the return of an ETP may deviate from the return of the tracked index or benchmark.

- Regulatory and tax risk: Risk that a government or a regulator may introduce regulatory or tax changes which can affect the value of securities in which the ETP invests, the value of the ETP units or the tax treatment of the ETP.

- Capital risk: Capital is fully at risk and is not covered by the provisions of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”), or any similar scheme.

- Leverage risk: If an investment results in a loss, such a loss will be increased by 2, 3 or 5 times, depending on the leverage used, which is greater than a direct investment in the underlying asset.

- Currency risk: If the underlying asset is quoted in a currency different from the listing currency, exchange rate fluctuations between these currencies would impact the price of the product (unless the product incorporates a currency hedge).

- Compound returns: Gains and losses are compounded over periods of more than one trading day, and as such will deviate from the leveraged performance of the underlying asset.

- Counterparty / Issuer risk: If the issuer were to default or become insolvent, the product will terminate. The amount investor would receive back depends on the value of a basket of collateral assets. That said, CoinShares ETPs are fully collateralised and have a 3rd party Trustee that acts independently for the benefit and in the interest of securityholders minimising credit risk.

- Liquidity risk: ETPs may be susceptible to liquidity risk. Their liquidity will generally correlate to the liquidity in the market for the underlying asset. Therefore, if the market for the underlying becomes illiquid, it is likely that the ETP product will also become illiquid.

- Prepayment risk: CoinShares reserves the right to make adjustments or substitutions, or even prepay the product, especially in case of events affecting the underlying asset. The early redemption of the product may result in total or partial loss of the amount invested.
