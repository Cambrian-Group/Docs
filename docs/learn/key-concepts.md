## What is ZSC?

<!-- CELO is a platform-native reserve and governance asset, serving as the primary asset in the stability mechanism (Mento) that supports stable digital currencies like cUSD and cEUR. CELO’s primary function is stabilization, ensuring the healthy velocity of assets that globally circulate and transact on Celo. CELO also serves as the key governance mechanism for the Celo Platform. Owning and using CELO supports the growth and development of the Celo Platform by enabling each CELO owner to vote on proposals that direct how the core technology operates today and in the future.
