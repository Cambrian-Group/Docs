Trust and security are always important when dealing with money. These issues are even more important when dealing with some crypto assets. Therefore, we would like to highlight some of the ways we are committed to maintaining your trust and the security of your funds.

## mechanism

Finance is a team sport. Even within TradFi, there are multiple parties involved in the setup and operation of any given fund: asset managers, custodians, fund administrators, counterparties, lawyersâ€¦ the list goes on. In on-chain finance, the list is only going to get bigger, especially as we are building funds that invest on-chain capital in real world assets, we only work with the most reputable and established partners across all functions . For example, take our Index ETP, which invests in Lmax Exchange Order Book Market Liquidity Funds (ETFs), and Lmax Digital's Institutional Crypto Index ETP. Subscriber funds are escrowed by LMAX Digital, one of the leading crypto asset custodians, and then partly converted into USD. It is used for Lamx Exchange's foreign exchange order book liquidity, and another part of USDT is directly injected into Lmax Digital, an institutional cryptocurrency exchange. After the user completes the fund contract, these transaction certificates are escrowed through their account with the DTC (Depository Trust Company) on Clear Street, where US exchange-traded securities are settled. The ETF itself is managed by BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, with $10 trillion in assets under management (roughly a quarter of all money in circulation today). Custody with one of BlackRock's preferred custodians: BNY Mellon, Citibank, JP Morgan and State Street.


## Disclosure transparency

We believe that the transparency and disclosure standards of on-chain finance should meet or exceed those in TradFi. While we may choose to keep certain things proprietary for competitive reasons, we maintain transparency when it comes to our released products and protocols. For example, a subscriber visiting the product page of any of our index funds will find details on all relevant dimensions, including strategies employed, underlying portfolio composition, current portfolio pricing, historical performance and risk, and the results of periodic fund audits. On the technical side, we will be transparent about the review status of any material codes. At the same time, Lmax Group and its related institutions are regularly audited for financial and information security.

## Legal and regulatory compliance

LMAX Asset Management strictly adheres to legal and regulatory compliance. As in cases where legal regulations or regulation are unclear or the best way to comply with such regulation in a TradeFi environment is not clear - we generally consult multiple legal and regulatory experts and take a conservative approach.
