This partnership is very aligned with Celo\u2019s mission and the services Deutsche Telekom provides its customers worldwide, the majority of which primarily use their phones to access financial services. By building on Celo\u2019s mobile-first platform, mobile carriers like Deutsche Telekom are able to seamlessly integrate mobile-friendly blockchain-based solutions and serve customers in new, meaningful ways.
